# Studing and analyzing a series of real dataset with R programming language

## Decription:
In this project, we was intended to study and analyze a series of real dataset. To begin analyzing a dataset, the first step was to get familiar with it. In the first step, this acquaintance can be made by observing the features of the dataset and distribution of the values and visualizing the data to make initial guesses about it. In the next step, by performing statistical tests, we made sure our guesses are correct and made our claims with certainty.

## Datasets Description:

| Dataset name       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Studentsâ€™ performance     | This dataset includes the information about a sample of students studying in two different institutes as well as their grades in three                                   different exams.       |
